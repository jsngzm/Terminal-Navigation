# Terminal Navigation with Bash and PowerShell

## Overview
This lab focused on basic command-line navigation in both Linux (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) environments. The goal was to compare and contrast how similar file system operations are performed in each terminal, and to practice fundamental commands related to navigation, file manipulation, and system organization.

## Skills Practiced
- Navigating directories with `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` (Bash) vs. `Set-Location` and `Get-ChildItem` (PowerShell)
- Creating, moving, copying, and removing files and folders using CLI
- Using `echo`, `cat`, `Write-Output`, and `Get-Content`
- Understanding cross-platform differences in terminal commands

## Tools Used
- Linux terminal (Pop!_OS Bash shell)
- Windows PowerShell (Windows 11)
- Text editor for CLI-based file creation and editing

## Key Takeaways
- Basic Bash and PowerShell commands may differ in syntax, but both are powerful tools for managing files and folders.
- PowerShell uses cmdlets (e.g., `New-Item`, `Move-Item`) instead of Bash-style commands.
- Familiarity with both environments is crucial for cross-platform administration and cybersecurity tasks.
